Data Analytics Advanced Project
# Al-Powered-Business-Intelligence-Dashboard

This project demonstrates how AI (Artificial Intelligence) and Business Intelligence (BI) combine to create a powerful, data-driven decision-support system.
Using Power BI, we analyzed sales performance, customer segments, and profit trends to uncover actionable business insights.

## 🧠 Where AI is Used
Power BI integrates several AI-powered features that enhance business analysis:
Copilot / AI Insights – Automatically generates DAX formulas, explanations, and visuals based on natural language prompts.
Smart Narrative Visual – AI summarizes your data into plain-language insights (e.g., “Sales grew by 15% in the West egion”).
Key Influencers Visual – Uses machine learning to identify the key factors influencing sales or profit.
These features transform the dashboard from simple visuals into an intelligent analytical assistant.

## 📊 Where Business Intelligence (BI) is Used
BI enables transforming raw data into interactive insights for strategic decision-making:
Data Preparation: Cleaned and modeled sales data using Power Query.
Data Visualization: Created dashboards with KPIs, trends, and region-wise analysis.
Interactivity: Used slicers for filtering by Year, Region, and Segment for dynamic exploration.
Performance Tracking: Built charts for profit margin, category contribution, and time-based growth.

## 📁 Dataset

## ⚙️ Key Measures (DAX)
These DAX formulas were created to calculate key business metrics:

Profit Margin = DIVIDE([Profit], [Sales])
Total Sales = SUM([Sales])
Total Profit = SUM([Profit])
Total Discount = SUM([Discount])

## 📈 Dashboard Features
✅ Total Sales, Profit, and Discount Cards
